    <p>
      I hail from Nepal, and my journey in the world of programming started when
      I got enrolled in the B.Sc.CSIT program at St. Xavier's College for my
      undergraduate studies. Currently, I am doing my post graduation in Digital
      Design and Development from North Island College. In addition to my
      fascination for the digital world, I love penning down my thoughts and
      reflect on my experiences in life. Not sure if this hobby of mine reflects
      my talent, but it certainly is a source of thought detox for me.
